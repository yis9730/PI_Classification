# Public repository architecture

## Design rule

Each executable has one responsibility and one place in the workflow. The public repository excludes notebook checkpoints, server-specific copies, intermediate experiments, and ambiguous duplicate scripts. The curated release replaces the former broad `development`/`experiment` grouping with `core` and `pipeline`, making the execution order evident from the directory tree.

## Workflow ownership

| Step | Owner directory | Main input | Main generated output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Public image curation | `code/data_curation` | original PIID/Kaggle downloads | prepared images and curation manifests |
| PIID/HUMC split creation | `code/pipeline` | prepared images; controlled HUMC labels | split tables and normalisation statistics |
| Model development | `code/pipeline` + `code/core` | splits and images | fold-specific checkpoints and training records |
| Internal/external validation | `code/pipeline` | checkpoints and test/external images | fold-specific prediction CSVs |
| Statistical tests | `code/analysis` | prediction CSVs | table-ready summary CSVs |
| Feature-space computation | `code/analysis` | images and fixed ResNet-18 feature weight | feature arrays, Table 3 values, representatives |
| Main figures | `code/visualization` | analysis outputs | figures 1–4 and supporting figures |

## Naming rules

- Use a verb-led file name for a runnable action: `train_`, `evaluate_`, `extract_`, `plot_`, `build_`, or `check_`.
- Keep reusable imports only in `core`; workflow scripts must not contain personal paths or host-specific configuration.
- Save numerical tables in `analysis` before plotting them in `visualization`. UMAP is a plot, so it belongs in `visualization`; silhouette and centroid distances are statistics, so they belong in `analysis`.
- A new main-manuscript output requires a command, inputs, output path, and public/controlled-data status in `MAIN_ARTIFACTS.md` before release.
